This repo is the backend(MongoDB, Processing API) and frontend(React[NextJs]) for the self hostable "Google drive" copy I'm working on.

The files that are served to the frontend are stored and managed in a different backend, because NextJS can't really serve dynamically created static content, or so I heard.
